          <h2 class="text-center">Ashadhi Ekadashi</h2>
          <p>Pandharpur Wari or Wari pronounced vaaree, is an annual pilgrimage (yatra) to the town of Pandharpur, which is the seat of Hindu God Vithoba in the Indian state of Maharashtra, in honour of the deity. Palakhis (palanquin processions) carrying the paduka (foot prints) of the deity and various saints, most notably Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram from the Warkari sect, are taken from their respective shrines to Pandharpur. Warkari is a Marathi term which means "one who performs the Wari" or "one who venerates the Vithoba". The tradition is more than 700 to 800 years old.
            The two most revered palakhis, Saint Dnyaneshwar's palakhi leaves from the town of Alandi, while Saint Tukaram's begins at Dehu; both these towns are located in Pune district of Maharashtra. This march on foot from various locations in Maharashtra to Vithoba temple, Pandharpur, attracts over a million pilgrims. The journey takes 21 days. Numerous palakhis join the main Tukaram and Dnyaneshwar palakhis along the way. The Wari culminates at the Vithoba temple on the holy occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi. Devotees from all over Maharashtra and nearby areas set out for Pandharpur, wearing holy basil beads and singing the glories of Vithoba and songs like "Gyanba Tukaram", commemorating the saints. Upon reaching Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi, these devotees take a holy dip in the sacred Chandrabhaga River/Bhima River before proceeding to visit the Vitthal Temple.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Ganeshotsav</h2>
          <p>
          Ganpati celebrations have been going on in Pune since the days of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In other words, Pune has been associated with Ganpati celebrations since the beginning. In 1893, Lokmanya Tilak reinvented the Ganpati celebrations in Pune with the hope of breaking the social barriers in a society where caste played a huge role in everyday life. Now the celebrations of this festival have spread to many parts of the country, but its roots are known to be in Pune.
                               The whole city takes on a festive look during these 10 days with the lanes and temples decorated and music blaring in every street. Although the idols in Pune are not as humongous as the idols in Mumbai which stand at 30-40 feet, the celebrations in Pune are more about tradition. Tradition is so important that the Ganpati mandals have a priority list when the idols are taken for immersion.

            <p>One of the revered temples of Pune, the Chaturshringi Mandir should be on your list of places to visit when you’re in Pune. Located on Senapati Bapat Road near Pune University in Gokhale Nagar, this temple has been the place for the devotees of Mahakali and Shri Chaturshringi for ages.
